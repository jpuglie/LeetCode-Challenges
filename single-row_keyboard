Purpose: Given a string keyboard of length 26 indicating the layout of the keyboard (indexed from 0 to 25), 
         initially your finger is at index 0. To type a character, you have to move your finger to the index of the desired character.
         The time taken to move your finger from index i to index j is |i - j|.
Assumptions: keyboard length is 26 characters
             keyboard variable contains each English lowercase letter exactly once in some order.
             1 <= word.length <= 10^4
             word[i] is a lowercase English letter.
